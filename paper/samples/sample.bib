abstract = {We present an investigation of mechanically-actuated hand-held controllers that render the shape of virtual objects through physical shape displacement, enabling users to feel 3D surfaces, textures, and forces that match the visual rendering. We demonstrate two such controllers, NormalTouch and TextureTouch, which are tracked in 3D and produce spatially-registered haptic feedback to a user's finger. NormalTouch haptically renders object surfaces and provides force feedback using a tiltable and extrudable platform. TextureTouch renders the shape of virtual objects including detailed surface structure through a 4\texttimes{}4 matrix of actuated pins. By moving our controllers around while keeping their finger on the actuated platform, users obtain the impression of a much larger 3D shape by cognitively integrating output sensations over time. Our evaluation compares the effectiveness of our controllers with the two de-facto standards in Virtual Reality controllers: device vibration and visual feedback only. We find that haptic feedback significantly increases the accuracy of VR interaction, most effectively by rendering high-fidelity shape output as in the case of our controllers.},

This understanding is used in digital fabrication processes by creating objects with high-resolution surface variations to influence a user’s tactile perception. As the design of such surface haptics commonly relies on knowledge from real-life experiences, it is unclear how to adapt this information for digital design methods. In this work, we investigate replicating the haptics of real materials. Using an existing process for capturing an object’s microgeometry, we digitize and reproduce the stable surface information of a set of 15 fabric samples. In a psychophysical experiment, we evaluate the tactile qualities of our set of original samples and their replicas. From our results, we see that direct reproduction of surface variations is able to influence different psychophysical dimensions of the tactile perception of surface textures. While the fabrication process did not preserve all properties, our approach underlines that replication of surface microgeometries benefits fabrication methods in terms of haptic perception by covering a large range of tactile variations. Moreover, by changing the surface structure of a single fabricated material, its material perception can be influenced. We conclude by proposing strategies for capturing and reproducing digitized textures to better resemble the perceived haptics of the originals.},

abstract = {Manipulating a virtual object with appropriate passive haptic cues provides a satisfying sense of presence in virtual reality. However, scaling such experiences to support multiple virtual objects is a challenge as each one needs to be accompanied with a precisely-located haptic proxy object. We propose a solution that overcomes this limitation by hacking human perception. We have created a framework for repurposing passive haptics, called haptic retargeting, that leverages the dominance of vision when our senses conflict. With haptic retargeting, a single physical prop can provide passive haptics for multiple virtual objects. We introduce three approaches for dynamically aligning physical and virtual objects: world manipulation, body manipulation and a hybrid technique which combines both world and body manipulation. Our study results indicate that all our haptic retargeting techniques improve the sense of presence when compared to typical wand-based 3D control of virtual objects. Furthermore, our hybrid haptic retargeting achieved the highest satisfaction and presence scores while limiting the visible side-effects during interaction.},

abstract = {Current techniques for haptics in immersive virtual environments (IVEs) allow users to perceive materials while exploring virtual surfaces. However, these experiences are usually restricted to the properties defined during the design phase of the IVE. Analogous to drawing in virtual reality (VR), we propose the concept of haptic design by granting users the ability to (re-)configure haptic feedback in their IVEs through changes of virtual objects' material properties. To study this concept, we considered how fabric sample books provide insights of material configurations by allowing us to explore different visual-haptic combinations. As an initial approach, we created the Haptic Palette, a dynamic passive haptic feedback controller where visual augmentations on top of physical textures allow users to experience mixed material perceptions. In this work, we posit the notion of haptic design for VR and present the results of an initial study using our Haptic Palette controller.},

Haptic Revolver's core haptic element is an actuated wheel that raises and lowers underneath the finger to render contact with a virtual surface. As the user's finger moves along the surface of an object, the controller spins the wheel to render shear forces and motion under the fingertip. The wheel is interchangeable and can contain physical textures, shapes, edges, or active elements to provide different sensations to the user. Because the controller is spatially tracked, these physical features can be spatially registered with the geometry of the virtual environment and rendered on-demand. We evaluated Haptic Revolver in two studies to understand how wheel speed and direction impact perceived realism. We also report qualitative feedback from users who explored three application scenarios with our controller.},

While VR easily allows changes to visual appearances, modifying haptic impressions remains challenging. Existing passive haptic techniques require access to a large set of tangible proxies. To reduce the number of physical representations, we look towards fabrication to create more versatile counterparts. In a user study, 3D-printed hairs with length varying in steps of 2.5 mm were used to influence the feeling of roughness and hardness. By overlaying fabricated hair with visual textures, the resolution of the user's haptic perception increased. As changing haptic sensations are able to elicit perceptual switches, our approach can extend a limited set of textures to a much broader set of material impressions. Our results give insights into the effectiveness of 3D-printed hair for enhancing texture perception in VR.},

ABSTRACT = {Texture recognition is important for robots to discern the characteristics of the object surface and adjust grasping and manipulation strategies accordingly. It is still challenging to develop texture classification approaches that are accurate and do not require high computational costs. In this work, we adopt a bionic tactile sensor to collect vibration data while sliding against materials of interest. Under a fixed contact pressure and speed, a total of 1000 sets of vibration data from ten different materials were collected. With the tactile perception data, four types of texture recognition algorithms are proposed. Three machine learning algorithms, including support vector machine, random forest, and K-nearest neighbor, are established for texture recognition. The test accuracy of those three methods are 95\%, 94\%, 94\%, respectively. In the detection process of machine learning algorithms, the asamoto and polyester are easy to be confused with each other. A convolutional neural network is established to further increase the test accuracy to 98.5\%. The three machine learning models and convolutional neural network demonstrate high accuracy and excellent robustness.},

# Glossary of Terms

## Technical Terms

**%beat**: Musical timing unit expressing deviations as percentage of beat duration (e.g., 6% beat = 23ms at 120 BPM)

**DTW**: Dynamic Time Warping - algorithm for optimal alignment between score and performance

**F1**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, ranging 0-1 (higher better)

**IOI**: Inter-Onset Interval - time between consecutive note onsets

**MAE**: Mean Absolute Error - average magnitude of deviations

**MT3**: Multi-Track Music Transcription model for audio-to-MIDI conversion

**RMSE**: Root Mean Square Error - standard deviation of prediction errors

**Velocity**: MIDI parameter representing note loudness (0-127 scale)

## Musical Terms

**Crescendo**: Gradual increase in loudness

**Diminuendo**: Gradual decrease in loudness

**Duplet**: Two equal notes played in the time of three

**Rubato**: Expressive timing flexibility in performance

**sf/fp**: Sforzando/forte-piano - sudden loud then soft dynamics

## System-Specific Terms

**Prescription**: Quantified corrective action with specific location and magnitude

**Target curve**: Professional reference performance for dynamics matching

**Three-layer evaluation**: Synthetic recovery + simulated improvement + external judge validation

## Statistical Terms

**Cohen's d**: Effect size measure (0.2=small, 0.5=medium, 0.8=large)

**Confidence interval**: Range containing true parameter with specified probability

**p-value**: Probability of observing results if null hypothesis true

**ROC-AUC**: Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (discrimination ability)

# Paper Update Summary - ProfyNet

## Overview
The main.tex file in `/home/kazuki/Projects/Profy/paper/` has been successfully updated to reflect our ProfyNet research findings.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Title and Authors
- **Old Title**: "Beyond Diagnosis: Prescriptive AI Coaching for Piano Performance with Quantified Corrective Actions"
- **New Title**: "ProfyNet: Professional Piano Performance Assessment Using High-Resolution Sensor Data and Local Attention Mechanisms"
- **Authors**: Updated to Kazuki Yamamoto, Takeshi Kojima, Yoshiaki Koizumi, and Jun Rekimoto

### 2. Abstract (sections/0_abstract.tex)
Completely rewritten to focus on:
- Multimodal deep learning framework distinguishing professional vs amateur performances
- Key findings: professionals use 54% fewer key presses with 51% higher velocity consistency
- Technical achievements: F1=0.625 (83% improvement over MERT baseline)
- Architecture innovations: local attention with 87% complexity reduction
- Parameter efficiency: 99.9% reduction (288K vs 330M)

### 3. Introduction (sections/1_introduction.tex)
Rewritten to emphasize:
- The limitations of audio-only approaches (MERT achieves only F1=0.342)
- Importance of high-resolution sensor data (1000Hz, 88 keys)
- Statistical analysis revealing professional efficiency patterns
- Four main contributions: comprehensive analysis, novel architecture, interpretability, empirical validation

### 4. Methodology (sections/3_proposal.tex)
Completely replaced with ProfyNet architecture description:
- Problem formulation for professional vs amateur classification
- Statistical feature extraction (6 key features)
- Dilated temporal convolutions for multi-scale patterns
- Local attention mechanism (window=100, O(T·w) complexity)
- Feature fusion and classification
- Training strategy with custom loss and data balancing
- Implementation efficiency optimizations

### 5. Keywords and Metadata
- Updated keywords to reflect sensor data analysis and attention mechanisms
- Changed conference year to 2024
- Updated copyright year
